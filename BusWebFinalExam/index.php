			<h3>Freelancing Rates</h3>
			<ul>
	<ol><div class="query">
 <li><p>What factors should be considered when setting an hourly rate for freelancing? Prior to learning about these factors, how would you have set an hourly rate for freelancing?</p></li>
        
        
         </div><!-- END QUERY -->
                        
                        <div class="myAnswer">
        
        
        <p>There are plenty of 'hourly-rate' calculators online that will offer a simple one-size-fits most solution to how to determine your hourly rate as a freelancer. Many may argue that those tools may simply be for statistical use rather than literal-- Or simply a tool for clients to assume their developers are ripping them off. The question still poses, how do you set an hourly rate on your own?</p>
                            
                          <p>  Immediately when thinking about this question, the word that comes to mind is, "relative."</p>
            
          <p>  I know, it's a sophisticated word that really shows how educated and palate-enriched I've become over the past few years. However, each developer and client will have a mix of their own needs that will always be unique. In my opinion, even a developer should never have a fixed hourly rate. It should fluctuate depending on the factors I've become familiar with:</p>
           <p> <strong>Overhead charges</strong> such as rent, supplies, software, insurance, taxes, and a base salary expectancy comparative to what someone in your field is expected to make. If you bid too low, you will undercut yourself and the market you serve. If you list your price too high, you'll have problems finding work. Charges will also fluctuate depending on if you pay for extra plugins or software for a single clients needs.</p>
           <p> <strong>Experience</strong>: are you charging for senior experience, or do you need their project as a skill-building piece? Sometimes you may have to undercut yourself in order to gain a reputation that may benifit you in the long run, such as being able to show future clients that you built something for so-and-so. How impressive!</p>
           <p> <strong>Services</strong>: are you offering maintenance after the site is published? Are you offering technical support or teaching them how to use what you've been leased to create for them?</p>
           <p><p> <strong>Location</strong>: Where are you working? Are you paying for office space, or are you working from home? How much overhead is reasonable to charge based on your work environment?</p>
           <p> <strong>How big is the project?</strong> When creating a contract with a client, most clients do not want to see the price go up as more and more time goes by. Plan your project well, and create a fixed rate based on how much time you think you will spend on it, as well as calculating overhead and software charges. That way, the client will be much more understanding when prices go up after something outside of the contract gets added later, due to their request rather than you taking longer than expected.</p>
          
                            </p>
        
        <p>A really fun cost calculator from <a href="http://thenuschool.com/">thenuschool.com</a> based it's result on the factors:</p>
         
        <p>What is your hourly rate? (My answer: $20)</p>
        <p>How many hours to you estimate working? (200)</p>
        <p>Is te project interesting? (meh)</p>
        <p>After the project... (will look good on my portfolio)</p>
        <p>Based on these answers, I should charge $7,200 with a lowest price ("break-even") price of $4,400.</p>
        <p>Can it be that easy? In this case, the factors are a bit unclear and vague, leaving little room to adjust calculating factors bassed on location or otherwise. As of December 2014, this website offers an online class "<a href="http://thenuschool.com/the-pricing-class/">How To Price Like A Pro</a>", which brings up the idea that it may be useful to invest time into getting to understand your financial needs and how to, indubitably, <em>price like a pro</em>.</p>
        
        <p> It's okay to experiement with your rates. You don't have to come up with the perfect plan in the beginning. Ater playing with your rates and charges for a few projects over the span of a year or two, you will have a better understanding of your needs, as well as what a client will expect and agree to. Then, you may be able to create a template for how you charge clients.</p>
                            <p> Before I considered some of these factors, I would have most likely created a simple algorithm to determine an hourly rate based on a salary and would have undercut myself. I feel that having a spreadsheet as part of your contract to account for and calculate fees and charges is a fantastic idea, as it is flexible and allows you to draw a very simple map for your client, which makes both parties happy.</p>

			<h3>Facebook Terms and Policies Update</h3>
			<ul><ol>
  <div class="query">    
  <li><p>Facebook will be updating its terms and policies on January 1, 2015 and introducing Privacy Basics. How will these changes impact your use of Facebook? What surprises you about these changes? Are there any areas that cause you to be skeptical or concerned over privacy? If so, what are they and why?</p></li>
        
   </div><!-- END QUERY -->
                        
                        <div class="myAnswer">
              As of Fall 2014, Facebook's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/terms-updates/?ref=notif&notif_t=data_policy_notice" >Terms and Policies</a> page reads the following:
                            
                             
                            <div id="scrollboxMed" class="facebook">
                                        <?php require_once('inc/facebookTerms.inc'); ?>
                </div><!-- end scrollbox-->
                           
                <div class="note">   <br/><br/>Note: I decide to copy the text in the event that at some point in time, my link provides different information than what I am basing my feedback upon.        </div><!--end italic use of query class-->
                            
                            
                            <p>With their newest Terms and Policies update, Facebook has created an easy-to-access document called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/basics">Privacy Basics</a> which they describe as "tips and a how-to guide" which is written in a short, clear and easy-to-read format for the general user. I appreciate that one can read through updates without being confused by a long and dry document with technical jargon. However there are few aspects that I am finding harder to swallow... </p>
                                           
                          <p>One such aspect is that Facebook is employing a 'Buy' button that helps people discover and purchase products without leaving Facebook. I am interested in what direction this will take. Will facebook try to be the next Amazon? Will it slowly morph into the mess that MySpace became after trying to imitate iTunes? I am skeptical about whether this 'Buy' button will be useful or desirable. Frankly, the concept creeps me out -- especially with the use of the string "without leaving Facebook" when explaining that this button will help people discover and purchase products. It makes me feel like they are trying to become the only website poeple ever need to use.</p>  
                    
                          <p>Facebook's statements about privacy and use of information appeared to be helpful at first glance, but when trying to find specific examples, you are only greeted with vague explanations such as "we give you the option" and "we ask your permission". However, I feel that in many cases access to features will be denied to users unless these "options" are accepted. </p>
                            
                            <p>For example, if you wish to an app connected to Facebook, but do not want Facebook to use your information to give that data to third-party services, there is no non-data collecting alternative. This forces you to accept the terms if you wish to use that feature at all. </p>
                                
                                
                             <p>Their description of how they <em>do</em> use this data is also vague, implying only that they will "improve your experience". An example of data usage Facebook provides is, "...if you're locked out of your Instagram account, you can use your Facebook information to recover your password". </p>
                                 
                             <p>Another section states that you can control the types of ads you see using Facebook's new 'ad preferences' feature, which will "help advertisers reach people with relevant ads without telling them who you are". So what <em>do</em> they do with it? The only answer they provide is that, "We use the information we collect to improve your experience". </p>  
                           
                            
           <p>So, how will things change about how I use facebook?</p>  
                            
                            <p>
                          <!--  - I will read the agreements for each app from now on, so I know in which angle i'm getting ...respected. -->
                                
                      I am interested in furthering my research in the development of the "buy" button, and what the actual implementation will look like as well as who the products will be coming from. I will also change my ad preferences to see the changes that apply to me. Finally, I plan on being more careful with which third party apps I agree to connect to facebook for the sake of an easer login. Thanks, Facebook for the eye opener!

                        <div class="myAnswer">
                            
                          <p>I chose to read the End User License Agreement for <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a>, an open source free SFTP client, FTP client, WebDAV client and SCP client for Windows. I chose this software specifically because it is the one I abuse the most, yet know nothing about its terms. Many of the tools I could have written about are evolving, competing softwares that I may jump between so often that I would create an obsolscent case study out of in this particular case. WinSCP is one of the few tools that I have stuck with and prefer to stay loyal to.</p>  
                            
                          <p>Here's what I learned:</p>  
                         
                            <img src="img/winSCP-agreement.PNG" title="WinSCP user agreement upon install" />
                            
                            <p>When installing software, such as WinSCP, you are greeted by the EULA that's we've all grown to ignore. I think most of us know that there are things in there that we would rather be blissful and ignorant to rather than take responsibility for handling software like literate adults, and understanding the full intentions and restrictions that apply. Take a look at WinSCP's EULA:</p>
                        
                         
                            <div id="scrollboxSm">
              <?php require_once('inc/EULA.inc'); ?>
  </div><!-- end scrollbox-->
                        
                       <p>The license actualy is a bit humorous, stating, "The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program.."</p>
<p>I like that they point out that the term "free" as in "free software", as the case is here, means freedom-- not price. The freedom provided is the given right to distribute copies of the software, even if you charge. This freedom also permits that you have access to the source sode and can change the program or use it to create distributive works. However, you cannot change the license itself. The "catch" is, by accepting the terms and distributing copies of the software you  accept the responsibility to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>This means, if you distribute the software, whether for free or for a charge, this unchanged license remains the same, and they can then do what they wish to the software just as you were given the right to. You must make sure they have access to the source code and this license, so they know their rights.</p>
<p>Luckily, this EULA did not give me any conflicts with how I use this software. However, I did learn what is covered, and expected to be covered (read clause 11: Patents) in a license. By reading this EULA, I understand more risks and vulnerabilities that could apply to me in the furutre. I will most likely refer to this nd other EULA's in the future when authoring my own.</p>
<p>Most users click the “I Agree” button without reading the EULA. However, is this not the best practice. The EULA clearly stated, in this case, that by accepting the terms there are responsibilities ad liabilities being placed onto the aceptee. There are also terms that are delightful to learn such as the allowances and rights you are given when accepting terms. In both cases, it is important to know exactly what the software you are using expects of you. Clearly, if you intend on making profit or not from any software or product, there is possibility to run into unexpected issues which could later turn into your resposibility, just as you had accepted.</p>
 <p>EULA's in general could benefit from a redesign in order to better inform users of the software, especially by containing less jargon and conveluted definitions. In the Open Source License Agreement I chose to define, the authorship was very unclear, and it took me multiple times to re-read the same pagges and cross examining definitions to understand what was being said.</p>
<p>This particular EULA was very clear, well-worded, and even humorous. The voice of the EULA was friendly and far from condescending. There was no jargon; each word was fully digested and appreciated by this individual.  </p>

<p>Liability laws and costs provide a way to avoid clients being delivered badly designed, poorly implemented features, inadequate testing and security vulnerabilities from software bugs by raising the risk of raising the developers' costs rather than the clients. This creates a gap between con artists-- creating bad software with intention of the customer coming back to fix it-- and developers who work hard to create a standard of best interest from the beginning, regardless if it is in their financial best interests.</p>
<p>Liability forces software companies to think twice before changing something, and to protect the data they're entrusted with. Though it may be easier (and more desirable) to blame a malicious attacker, Liability means that those in the best position to fix the problem are actually responsible for the problem. </p>
<p>This is good news until a developer is faced with an issue that was not expected or designed to avoid. How do you test against security threats you don’t know exist in your mobile app? Security attacks can be caused by a third-party component, as well as in your own software. The difference bewteen Known vulnerabilities, and Unknown is simply that Known vulnerabilities have already been found and reported, while Unknown vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that have not yet been found. </p>
<p>It is in a developers best interest to keep looking for security vulnerabilitiyes by getting familiar with all used third-party software packages and libraries as well as their licenses. Licenses can bind the developer to additional liabilities.  Open source and third party components are constantly evolving, so it is a good idea to do routine follow ups on updates to stay up to date with this information. Think about it,  if you have software that becomes out of date or the security gets breached often-- no one blames the attacker, they blame you for having poor software. The users perception is what counts, and it's up to you as the developer to ensure that as vulnerabilities evolve, so does your software.</p>
